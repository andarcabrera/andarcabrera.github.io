      <h2> May 23, 2015</h2>
      <p>Shereef Bishay, founder of DEVbootcamp, refers to the program as an ongoing experiment. Well, I have never in my life been so excited at the prospect of being a guinea pig. I look forward to putting my chef hat on and embarking on this road with a group of equally enthusiastic people. I think (and also heard from people who completed the program), that DEVbootcamp is a unique and life changing experience. It not only aims to equip you with a set of skills, but also empower you with the mindset and confidence to continue building on those skills, be it that they are coding, teamwork or (based on my site visit) improv. Not setting any high expectations here. Not at all.</p>
      <p>As much as I look forward to immerse myself in this experiment, I am still a little nervous about some aspects of the program. A life long introvert, the idea of exposing my ignorance in large groups of people, be it virtual or on site, makes me have the wrong kind of butterflies in my stomach. I can only hope that when the impostor syndrome wants to take over, I’ll be able to suppress it with some good old hard work, will power and some help from my colleagues and teachers.</p>
      <p>In keeping with the kitchen analogies that DEV seems to favor I’d like to say that I'm not a great cook in my personal kitchen. I can make a mean lentil soup and a couple Romanian dishes, but every once in a while I try to make a more sophisticated dish. It’s always messy and I get discouraged in the middle when I realize I’m actually missing some ingredients, or I put them in the wrong order, but they’re always edible and sometimes delicious.I hope that this experiment will be one of the latter.</p>
      <p>Bon appetit you all.</p>
