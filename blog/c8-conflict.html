      <p>A recent conflict that comes to mind is at one of my previous jobs.  After some people left from the company the rest of us had to absorb their workload.  I was happy to pitch in although my plate was already pretty full.  One task in particular was very time consuming and dull and when it came apparent that there were no plans to hire other people I reached out to discuss my responsibilities. I hoped that some of the tasks could be shifted around, especially the very tedious one which could be split between more people, and I could take on some other responsibilities to continue helping out with the increased work load.</p>
      <p> When I attempted to communicate my thoughts the response was that I just have to continue doing it with no further room left for discussion. I felt that I had no voice and that I was being undervalued and it bothered me there was not even an attempt to understand my angle and find a middle way.  Upon giving it some more thought I realized that everyone was under pressure and there was probably not a fast solution anyway even if they would have listened to me. So I focused on trying to automatize the task and make it less time consuming. In a few weeks I did manage to reduce substantially the time I was spending on it.    </p>
      <p>If I were to face a similar situation I would still try to communicate and find a solution that's beneficial for everyone but what I did learn from this episode is that there are more ways to approach a conflict and have a constructive attitude.  </p>
