      <h2>June 18, 2015 </h2>
      <p>When I signed up for DEVbootcamp, I knew I was going to experiment with a lot of new things, from what I will be learning to how I will be learning it. Working together with the other students on challenges (pairing) is a main requirement of the program and one that, to be honest, made me a little nervous.  I knew that people come into the program at different levels and I worried that I would not bring enough value to the session. Not to mention the guided pairing session where you are evaluated while working live on a challenge with someone you probably haven't met before.  </p>
      <p>I got a lot more comfortable once I started. I now look forward to the GPS as the instructors are providing valuable info all the time, and I also enjoy the regular pairing sessions and find that I push myself harder knowing that I have to work with someone. I learned from the other students and it added to the remote experience getting to know my colleagues before the on-site portion of the program.</p>
      <p>With that said, not all pairings are created equal and I found I enjoyed some more than others. They were particularly fun when we managed to create a report beyond the challenge itself and our personality came out. I found rewarding the pairings where both of us gave 100% and did out best to find solutions even if we went over the one hour recommended time. Some others felt a little artificial where people seemed like they just wanted to get the pairing requirement out of their way.</p>
      <p>One of the frustrating pairings was during a GPS where my pair took charge and they were going through the challenge very fast, proposing solutions. I hadn't even finished reading the requirements and they were already thinking out loud the solutions. That intimidated me and made me lose focus. In hindsight, I should have asked to please allow me to take some more time with it, but in the moment I just got lost. The feedback from the instructor reflected that and it was disappointing to me to appear un-engaged. I did recover later in the challenge but the whole experience left a sour taste.</p>
      <p>The feedback I received so far was pretty good and encouraging, and the constructive feedback I received didn't come as a shock as I know what my weak spots are. I do need to work on being able to receive criticism and not be disappointed, especially when I know it to be true.</p>
      <p>In writing feedback for other people the hardest part was to be specific and give actionable suggestions. I usually told my pair if I thought there was something that they could take advantage of or improve on (e.g. irb or terminal shortcuts, calling the methods) and reiterated it in the feedback.</p>
