      <p>Stereotype threat makes people aware of the negative stereotypes that exist about their group and can affect their decision making process or performance. When they focus on the stereotypes and their fear of confirming them, that can put more pressure on them and redirect their focus and ability. One example given in a study about stereotype threat is the under-performance of black students at tests that they were told measured intellectual abilities. When the same tests were given without mentioning the intellectual aspect, the black students performed as well or better than their white counterparts. </p>
      <p>It is important to be aware of the effects of stereotype threats and identify what kind of stereotypes you are exposed to and actively deal with them and your response to them. I feel that stereotype threat has affected decisions that I made in my life and I still feel aware of many of the same stereotypes but got better at coping with them. The main ones for me would be, identifying as a woman, an immigrant, and age .</p>
      <p>When I graduated college, I thought I should continue my education and get a more practical degree. Many of my friends studied IT and encouraged me to pursue that. I enrolled in a computer science program and dropped out after a few weeks. I was one of the few women in the class and, at 23, I was 4 years older than most of my colleagues who had just graduated high-school. I felt that I did not belong and that certainly I was not cut out to do that, and it was to late anyways. After being put on the spot in one physics lab where I was the only woman in the class, and the teacher continued to (in my opinion then) humiliate me, I made my final decision to drop out.  Looking back, of course, I realized I was more than capable to finish that program but at that time it seemed impossible.</p>
      <p>Almost 15 years later I am starting almost on the same path, this time in a more inclusive environment and an education model that fits better with my learning style, plus a group where 50% are women. But I am also different, and learned along the way to not let these stereotype threats guide my way in life. If I felt too old at 23, you can imagine I'm no spring chicken now either, but age has nothing to do with my ability to learn programming, besides giving me more motivation and a better work ethic. </p>
      <p>That was my personal experience, but it is just as important to pay attention to other people and what affects them and be mindful of that in our interactions. We can help each other be better people.</p>
