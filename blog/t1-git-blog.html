  <h1>To git or to GitHub</h1>
  <h2>The benefits of the two gits</h2>

     When I learned about version control, an old movie quote popped into my mind “this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship”.  I am pretty sure, as I take my first steps into coding, I will live with the perpetual feeling that I’m screwing something up with every line of code I’m adding to my Sublime text editor. So, what better way to stop the paranoia than git? Git allows you to ‘stop time’ by saving (‘committing’) your work regularly and then being able to return to those committed versions if you decide that you have to backtrack and take a different route. The way you do this is by keeping track of the files you’ve modified (‘git status’), adding the modified files in the queue to be committed (git add), and finally commiting the changes (git commit). When you are committing the  changes, you also need to type a message, as clear as possible, so that if you need to go back you know exactly which version to access (e.g. the version where I was eating healthy, working out, and looked like my profile picture).

        GitHub is git’s guardian angel. It is a remote repository that lives up in the cloud. GitHub has many advantages, of which I will mention two main ones: (i) it allows you to retrieve your work anytime and anyplace as long as you have an internet connection, and (ii) it is ideal for teamwork, especially if the team members are spread geographically.  Everyone can push the changes to GitHub and, making use of the Pull request feature, a project manager can easily coordinate and decide which contributions are to be included (merged) in the main project and advise others if they need to improve their code.
