    <p>
   A regular expression (also known as regex or regexp) is a special text string for describing a search pattern. A simple way to think about a regex is the find function in a text editor. You can find letters or words containing a particular pattern of characters. There are some special characters in regex such as <i>$,[] (),+, *, ^, /. etc.</i> that need to be escaped if they are part of the actual pattern. A regex is used to determine if there is a match in the string and/or take an action based on that match. Although it contain characters, the regex is not a string. It's a special notation.

    <p>The most simple form of a regular expression is the literal character (//) where you give a letter or series of letters and match the occurrences of those characters in the string. There are also more complex forms of regular expressions. For example you can search for a set of characters [bl], or a range of characters [l-m]. You can match a digit character <i>/d</i>, a word character <i>/w</i> or a space character <i>/s</i>. A dot matches any character. <i>s.ot</i> would match spot, spat, spit, etc. You can ignore or make characters optional</p>
    <p>Regular expressions are a powerful tool for text-processing problems but can also prove difficult to use and opaque so it's worth spending time learning about them.</p>
