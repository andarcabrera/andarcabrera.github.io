      <p>I completely agree that asking a question the right way is very important. In fact, I'm sure everyone can remember cases when they realized what the answer was as soon as they asked the question.  </p>
      <p> I think you should try to be as specific as possible with the question and give as many details as possible while at the same time being succinct. If the question is too general, people may not be able to pinpoint at what the issue is, or they can launch in a general and time consuming explanation, which may not solve your issue plus it's an unnecessary strain on their time if in trying to help you they explain concepts that you may already know or that have nothing to do with what you were actually trying to clarify.  It's easier when the question is asked in person as the person answering can have direct feedback from you and clarifying questions can be asked if needed. When asking on an online platform it's even more important to structure your questions in a way that's easy to understand and to the point.       </p>
      <p>Lastly, while asking questions is beneficial for the learning process, and especially encouraged at DBC, it should not be a substitute for individual research and an effort to first find a solution on your own.  If you have made an effort but still struggle with concepts, then it's the time to ask, listen and very important: thank the kind people who answer your questions.   </p>
