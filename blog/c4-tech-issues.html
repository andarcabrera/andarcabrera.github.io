      <h1 class="blogtext" id="blogtitle"> The labor issue <span><a href="../website/index1.html">HOME</a></h1>
      <h2>June 12, 2015 </h2>
      <p>The tech industry has changed so many aspects of our lives and the pace of innovation is not slowing down. But sometimes innovation comes at a price and we should be aware of the pitfalls and try to steer things in the right direction on whichever side of the innovation we are, be it as industry insiders, leaders, investors, consumers, etc.</p>
      <p>The issue I'll talk about is labor. In the past few years many e-platforms achieved great success acting as middlemen between consumers and service providers for transportation, house cleaning, moving, delivery, and other tasks. These companies do not employ their own people by use contractors. To name a few, companies like Uber, Homejoy, Handy, Lyft and others have started to be called <i> 1099 companies </i> for the labor practices they promote. I've heard more first hand accounts about Uber as many of my friends are cab drivers, and some have or are currently using Uber, but from my research I understand many of the other technology start ups are using this model to the same effect.</p>
      <p>Many of the new technology companies that are formed around platforms that act as intermediary between service providers and consumers, and attract millions of dollars in investment, are not as "sexy" and great for the contract workers that provide the actual services. While investors in Silicon Valley get millions of dollars in returns and profiles in the New Yorker, these workers work many times on less than minimum wage, have no benefits, and really no guaranteed income. </p>
      <p>As consumers, we may find it convenient to get a $10 ride or the house cleaned for $19. But would you feel as entitled to these services when you found out that the person who cleaned your house for $19 lives in a homeless shelter and the Uber driver needs food stamps?</p>
      <p>As I said before, many of my friends are cab drivers, a job that was always a good starting point for newly arrived immigrants, and offered a stable income. Cab drivers have to comply with licensing and safety regulations and their cost of doing business is higher as a result. But the cab company provides a car, insurance, maintenance, annual inspections and background checks and physicals for the drivers.  Uber bypasses all those requirements (and I don't have time here for the shady politics behind that) and still charges drivers 20% of the fare. Moreover, in some cases it encourages drivers to sign for subprime loans that they can't really afford.  </p>
      <p>NYT recently had an investigative report on nail saloons across the country and especially New York City. It revealed what hides behind that $20 mani/padi that is taken for granted by so many yuppies. The workers are in a state of indentured servitude working often for sub minimum wages and face significant health hazards. So before you take advantage of all these new technological perks ask yourselves who is really gaining and who is paying? I for one decided that I can throw some color on my nails myself and take the L. </p>
      <p>I think the solution here is evident. Make sure the people that make your company a success benefit from that as well. Don't focus only on the return to the millionaire investors. There is a social contract that should be respected and the corporate obligations can't all be shoved under the 1099 rug. </p>
