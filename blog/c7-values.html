      <p>When I think of times in my life when I was happy, I think of family and friends (close relationships) and also adventure. Let me explain.  </p>
      <p>By adventure I don't mean necessarily climbing the Half Dome (although that would be really cool), but just changing the status quo, even if there are no guaranteed rewards. In my case it was moving from one continent to another, changing jobs or moving away from unfulfilling relationships. It was not easy to make many of the changes but by shaking the status quo I always grew as a person, exposing myself to new environments and learning a lot in the process. It is the same sense of adventure that made me jump head first in the DBC program and it has been very rewarding so far. </p>
      <p>The relationship that I have with my family and friends is very important and it was also the reason I moved to Chicago, to be near my sister. Building meaningful relationships with the people around me is a value I try to live up to.  </p>
      <p>
        These values (and many more) will also be my main tools to combat stereotype threat at DBC. Knowing that I have a strong support system, including on sight, and being aware that embarking on something so new and intense will reveal many of my weaknesses, but that I will also come out more skilled and resilient, so if I expose my ignorance on some occasions, hopefully I'll be able to realize that it's a normal process, and that it has nothing to do with my gender or age.
