      <h2>How my concrete sequential thinking style got me thinking</h2>
      <p>Upon re-reading the description of the concrete sequential thinking style, I was reminded that I recognize many of those traits in my thinking style, but also can identify with many from the other three segments. That's probably the case for everyone.  I do like facts, structure, and direction and in that respect DEV was great. The curriculum gave me direction and the assignments and dead-lines gave me the structure, so I was helped and motivated to achieve more than I would have if I undertook this on my own.  </p>
      <p>The second segment I fall in according to the Grecorc chart is Abstract Random, and here the DEV experience was great in offering the pairing opportunities. Although nervous about the format in the beginning, I had wonderful learning experiences while pairing and got to know some interesting people. It's true that I was never much of the competitive person, but DEV encourages collaboration and teamwork, so I'd say I'm safe there.</p>
      <p>The third week was the most difficult one for me, as we started delving into Ruby, and the more difficult challenges in the later chapters. I was lucky to work with a pair who had some programming background and helped me understand some concepts better, but I'm not sure this is something I can just plough through on my own. </p>
      <p>This is the time when I really have to embrace the growth mind set, as I had moments when I was discouraged for not being able to grasp concepts and was tempted to think that maybe my mind is just not structured that way (I guess that's the fixed mindset I'm supposed to run away from).</p>
      <p>On the whole, it's been a wonderful ride so far. I feel that I made great progress even in these first three weeks from when I started, and while I have my moments of doubt and low confidence, I think that's normal and it's up to me to acknowledge them and march forward in spite of them. </p>
      <p>A big thank you to my colleagues and instructors. Being part of such an awesome community does make it all even better!</p>
